# Pomodoro Timer
Website application which implements a pomodoro timer, a utility for the Pomodoro time management technique.

## What Is a Pomodoro?
**The Pomodoro Technique** is a time management technique which uses set time lengths for alternating periods of work and break. The technique is named after the tomato shaped kitchen timers which the technique’s inventor used while developing the technique in college (pomodoro is Italian for tomato.)

The Pomodoro Technique works as follows:
1. Decide on the task to be accomplished. This can be something small or something larger, but it’s important that the task requires several minutes of undivided attention, and that you have a clear baseline for when the task is considered “done.”
2. Set your timer for the duration of your work period. Traditionally, this is 25 minutes, although you can experiment with what works best for you. This time period is a pomodoro.
3. Work on the task until the timer rings. During this time, you will give the task your full, undivided attention, and will not interrupt yourself from working on the task. If something external interrupts this work period, write down what you are working on, and come back to it later, starting a new pomodoro when you do so. It is important that pomodoros aren’t “split,” each pomodoro is a continuous period of undivided attention.
4. When the timer rings, you have completed your pomodoro. Mark down that you’ve completed a pomodoro, traditionally by putting a check mark on a piece of paper.
5. Take a short break after completing each pomodoro. This break is traditionally short, around five minutes. These breaks should be free of work related activities, such as phone calls or emails. After your break is finished, start another pomodoro.
6. Once you realize you’ve completed four pomodoros (such as by seeing you’ve put down four check marks on your sheet of paper), take a longer break. Traditionally, these breaks are 20 to 30 minutes long. Once finished with your break, continue with another round of pomodoros.

The Pomodoro Technique is used to make focusing on work easier. It uses short burst sessions followed by a break as a relaxing reward to allow the user to focus on the feeling of accomplishing smaller sub-tasks instead of worrying about far off deadlines. Taking regular breaks allows the user to avoid “burnout” caused by pushing themselves too hard. Meanwhile, having those break periods also allows the user to avoid distracting themselves during work periods, since there’s a time set aside for dealing with distractions set aside from work time. Finally, the technique also assists with organization, as it creates records of how long different tasks take to accomplish, which allows for better estimation of task times for future pomodoros.
