# Pomodoro Timer
Website application which implements a pomodoro timer, a utility for the Pomodoro time management technique.

## What Is a Pomodoro?
**The Pomodoro Technique** is a time management technique which uses set time lengths for alternating periods of work and break. The technique is named after a tomato shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro is Italian for tomato).
The steps of the pomodoro technique are as follows:
1. Decide on the task to be accomplished.
2. Set the timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the decided task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break (3-5 minutes), then return to step 2. After four breaks, go to step 5.
5. After four breaks, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), then reset your break count and go back to step 1.

The pomodoro technique is used because it makes it easier to get started on working if you know you don't have that long until a break. Additionally, since it requires the user to break down tasks into smaller, well-defined subtasks that can be completed in the pomodoro times. This helps with organization, and gives a feeling of consistent accomplishment as the smaller tasks are completed.
